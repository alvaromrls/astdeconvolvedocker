# Gnuastro Deconvolution Docker Environment

This repository provides a Docker environment for running Gnuastro and its deconvolution functionality. You can either build the Docker image locally or pull it from Docker Hub to quickly set up the environment.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker-compose

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alvaromrls/astdeconvolvedocker
cd astdeconvolvedocker
```

### 2. [A] Build the docker image (option 1)

It can take some time, you have time to make a coffe (and drink it).

```bash
docker build -t gnuastro-deconvolution .
```

### 2. [B] Pull the docker image (option 2)

If you prefer not to build the image locally, you can pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull alvaromrls/gnuastro-deconvolution:latest
```

### 3. Run the Docker using Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose run dev_environment
```

## Using the Image

### Files Synchronization

The `files` folder is synchronized between the Docker container and your host system. However, since this folder is included in the `.gitignore`, changes to it will not be tracked in Git. Feel free to modify `.gitignore` for your personal use if you want to track those changes.

### DS9 Compatibility

Please note that the image does not support directly opening images with DS9 inside the Docker container. While itâ€™s technically possible to run DS9 in Docker with additional configuration, it's easier to open the synchronized files in DS9 directly on your host system instead.
